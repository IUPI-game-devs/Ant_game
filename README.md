### World Map:

The map was made with 3d object, terrain. The dimentions of the map is 256 x 256. We used this illustration to make the biomes of the map.

We used the terrain tools to make the map look more natural. We used the following textures:

We didn't want to use textures that were too realistic because we wanted to keep the game in a low poly style. We added some assest to make the map more interesting and to make it look more natural. We added rocks, leafs, water and other things.

We also added a tunnel system to the map. This was to simulate the ant colony. We made use of th probuilder tool to make the tunnels. With the cone we were able to make the tunnel entrances and connections to the eliptical chambers. These chambers were made with the sphere tool and set the normals to the inside. We also placed some lights inside of the tunnels to make it look more interesting. We chose an amber lights to make it look like natural glowing fungus or something similar to give light to the tunnels.

Most of the work was done with the help of the code writen in class, like the player script and the new input system.
